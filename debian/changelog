 linssid (3.5-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * New vendor database and search scheme that now looks in ieee oui large,
    medium, and small block databases. Previously only looked in large
    block database because that's where 99% of all devices are found.
  * Displays SSID of attach points with no SSID as "<hidden>".

 linssid (3.4-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Fixes location and owner of ".linssid.prefs" and "LinSSID.datalog".
    Instead of placed in /root and owned by root they are now placed
    in "$HOME" and owned by "$USER" when launched with linssid-pkexec which
    is the normal .desktop launch.
  * Fixed some wrongly addressed cosmetic icons.
  * Updated vendor data file. (Version 3.3 had some trailing characters that
    messed up data logging.)
  * Sundry under-the-hood optimizations.

 linssid (3.3-1) bionic; urgency=low

linssid (3.2-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Now shows mark for control channel on the channel plots. Very useful
    for making sure your control channel(s) don't overlap with the neighbors'.
  * Fixes potential memory leak with attached plots.

 -- Warren Severin <wseverin@warsev.com>  Thu, 01 Jun 2018 07:30:00 -0700

linssid (3.1-1) bionic; urgency=low

  * Big change - now requires polkit (policykit) authentication. No way
    around this as debian/ubuntu/* has emasculated su and sudo.
    A step backward IMHO. Now the whole app must run as root. So, all
    of the prefs and log files are now in /root and are owned by root. And,
    the whole app must run as root instead of just well-tested system parts.
  * Major rewrite of the synchronization between the main window and the data getter.
  * Install rewrite
  * Desktop file fix
  * Updated vendor database

linssid (2.8-1) xenial; urgency=low

  * Rewrite to use nl80211 and the iw utility instead of iwlist.
    Note that this version may not work with some systems that are
    using a pre-3.0 kernel that doesn't support nl80211.
    Also note that iw may change in the future and if the output format
    of iw changes it might break some features in this version of LinSSID.
  * Now displays bandwidth and center channel.
